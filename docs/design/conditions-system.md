## What a "condition" is

A **condition** models an interactive TUI scenario that a provider (Claude /
Codex) surfaces while a session is live and that the GUI must render and let the
user resolve. Today's live conditions:

| Provider | Kind                       | UI                          | Resolves by |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Claude   | `claude.trust-dialog`      | modal "Trust this folder?"  | keystroke   |
| Claude   | `claude.permission-prompt` | modal permission request    | keystroke   |
| Claude   | `claude.resume-prompt`     | inline strip                | keystroke   |
| Claude   | `claude.compaction`        | inline strip (read-only)    | —           |
| Claude   | `claude.slash-picker`      | (not rendered via outlet)   | keystroke   |
| Codex    | `codex.trust-dialog`       | modal "Trust this dir?"     | keystroke   |
| Codex    | `codex.approval`           | inline approval strip       | keystroke   |
| Codex    | `codex.switch-model-prompt`| (emitted, no view yet)      | keystroke   |

Every live condition today resolves by writing a **raw keystroke string into
the session PTY**. Those keystrokes are the entire contract with the underlying
provider's real terminal program: `'\r'` accepts, `'3\r'` denies a permission
prompt, `'\x1b'` cancels, arrow escapes (`'\x1b[A'` / `'\x1b[B'`) move a
selection. The provider's TUI reads them and advances its own state machine.

## Wire format (UNCHANGED by the registry framework)

Both providers emit a unified snapshot:

```ts
ProviderConditionSnapshot =
  | { provider: 'claude'; conditions: ClaudeConditionMap; ts: number }
  | { provider: 'codex';  conditions: CodexConditionMap;  ts: number }
```

where each map is `Partial<Record<kind, { kind, state, actions }>>` — at most
one live record per kind. `state` is provider-specific; `actions` is the
generic `ConditionAction[]` (a `pty` keystroke action, or the dormant `custom`
action). See `src/shared/types/providerConditions.ts` (provider state shapes +
unions) and `src/shared/conditions-core/contract.ts` (the generic action/record
primitives that file now re-exports).

### Layer 1 — conditions-core (the framework)

The core knows **nothing about specific kinds**. It defines two halves of a
condition's contract and the machinery to route + dispatch:

- **The view half** (`view.ts`, consumed now): a `ConditionView<K,S>` bundles
  everything the renderer needs for ONE kind — its `Component`
  (`React.ComponentType<ConditionViewProps<S>>`), an optional `attention(state)`
  classifier, and a `layout` hint. `ConditionViewProps<S> =
  { state: S; actions: ConditionAction[]; dispatch }`.
- **The headless half** (`contract.ts`, FORWARD-LOOKING, not consumed in this
  PR): a `ConditionModule<K,I,S>` bundles a `detect(input) → state | null`, an
  `actions(state) → ConditionAction[]`, and an optional `resolve`. This is the
  contract the headless emitters will be authored against in a later PR.

The **generic outlet** (`ConditionOutlet.tsx`) takes `{ snapshot, registry,
dispatch }`, iterates `Object.values(snapshot.conditions)`, looks each record's
`kind` up in `registry`, and renders `<View.Component state actions dispatch/>`.
It **preserves snapshot key order** so blocking modals stack identically to the
old outlets, and it **skips unknown kinds** (an older app paired with a newer
headless emitter simply doesn't draw a condition it has no view for — the same
graceful-old-client posture the wire format already assumes).

The **dispatch driver** (`dispatch.ts`) turns a chosen action into a side
effect. The `pty` arm calls `sendInput`/`onSend` with the action's raw `data`.
The `custom` arm **throws** — see "Why custom is dormant".

Type-safety guardrail: the core stores **erased** views
(`ConditionView<string, unknown>`) in `Record<string, ConditionView>`. That
erasure is sound precisely because the core's only job is to route by `kind`; it
never reads `state`. The strongly-typed `S` is re-established inside each view
module (which knows its own kind). No `any` in the core — `unknown` + the
kind-keyed registry.

### Layer 2 — provider modules (adapters over existing modals)

Each provider owns a `views.tsx` that wraps its **existing** modal components as
thin view adapters and exports a `Record<string, ConditionView>` registry built
from an `as const` list:

```ts
export const CODEX_VIEW_LIST = [approvalView, codexTrustView] as const
export const CODEX_VIEWS = Object.fromEntries(
  CODEX_VIEW_LIST.map(v => [v.kind, v as unknown as ConditionView]),
)
```

The `as const` list is the source of truth, so later PRs can derive the
provider's kind union via `typeof CODEX_VIEW_LIST[number]['kind']` without
restating it.

**Adapter shape.** We do NOT rewrite the modals. Each adapter renders the
existing modal with its EXACT current prop shape, and translates its
`onSend(data)` callback into `dispatch({ kind: 'pty', id: 'raw', label: '',
data })`. The dispatch pty arm then calls `onSend(data)` / `sendInput` — the
byte-for-byte same send path the old per-provider outlets used. The modals keep
their exact keystrokes, their capture-phase keydown handlers, and their
state→props mappings (e.g. Codex approval's `commandParts ?? command.split(/\s+/)`
fallback, compaction's `visible && phase` guard, each modal's `visible` gate).

`attention` per view matches today's `selectors.ts` behavior
(permission/approval → `ACTION`, trust → `TRUST`, resume → `RESUME`,
compaction-with-error → `ERROR`). **It is defined but not consumed in PR-1** —
see "Deferred seam".

### Layer 3 — unchanged relay (the data-flow seam)

The path from "headless saw a condition" to "renderer applies a snapshot" is
untouched by the registry framework:

```
headless emitter
  → sessionManager (emits a 'conditions' payload, ~sessionManager:457)
  → forwarder.ts:60   manager.on('conditions', p => sendToMainWindow('session:conditions', p))
  → IPC 'session:conditions'
  → useIpcSubscriptions.ts: applyConditionSnapshot(current, snapshot) (~:195, applied ~:1065)
  → runtime.conditions
  → TileLeaf.tsx (~:510)  <ProviderConditionOutlet conditions={runtime.conditions} onSend={send}/>
```

`send` (TileLeaf's prop) is already bound to the active session and ultimately
reaches `window.api.sendInput(sessionId, data)` → `session:input`. PR-1 reuses
that `onSend` verbatim via `makeDispatchFromOnSend`.

## Why `custom` actions are dormant

The wire `ConditionAction` union includes a `custom` action (resolve via a named
structured resolver instead of a keystroke). **No live condition emits one.**
Wiring a `session:resolveCondition` IPC + a main-side resolver now would be dead
code with zero callers — code that can rot before its first real use. So the
dispatch `custom` arm **throws loudly** rather than silently no-op'ing: if some
future path ever emits a custom action before the wiring exists, we find out
immediately. The first PR that introduces a genuine custom condition adds the
IPC + resolver and replaces the throw.

## CRITICAL DESIGN NOTE — `detect()` is free-form

**`detect()` is a free-form function — the detection toolkit is an OPTIONAL
helper library, never a straitjacket; any parser may use its own regex/cursor
logic and reach for shared helpers only where they fit.**

`ConditionModule.detect` is typed as an arbitrary `(input: I) => S | null`. The
type imposes NO structure on HOW detection happens. The planned shared detection
toolkit (regex/cursor helpers) and the planned `sendThenReparse` driver (write a
keystroke, wait for the screen to settle, re-run detect to confirm the new
state) are **helper libraries** a parser may opt into. A parser is free to use
entirely ad-hoc regex/cursor logic and reach for shared helpers only where they
happen to fit. Neither the toolkit nor `sendThenReparse` is built in PR-1; they
are PLANNED.

## Registration model

- Each provider exports an `as const` array of `defineView({...})` results.
- The `Record<string, ConditionView>` registry is derived from that array.
- Provider unions are derived from the array via `typeof` where practical; the
  core stores erased views (sound because it routes by `kind` only).
- `defineModule` / `defineView` are identity helpers — they exist only to give
  call sites clean inference of `K`/`I`/`S` from the object literal.

## Vendor-sync plan for the headless core (packages are submodules)

`packages/claude-code-headless` and `packages/codex-headless` are **git
submodules**. The condition-module headless core (the `detect`/`actions`/
`resolve` implementations that will eventually run inside the headless
processes) cannot simply `import` from the app's `src/shared/conditions-core`
across the submodule boundary. The plan:

- The app's `src/shared/conditions-core/contract.ts` is the **authoritative**
  definition of the `ConditionModule` contract and the wire action primitives.
- The headless side gets a **vendored copy** of the contract (sync'd from the
  app, not a live import) so the submodule stays self-contained and buildable on
  its own. A check (golden/diff) keeps the vendored copy byte-identical to the
  app's source of truth; drift is a CI/review failure.
- App↔headless agreement is verified by a **byte-for-byte golden snapshot
  check**: feed a recorded screen buffer through both the old emitter and the
  new module-based emitter and assert the emitted `ProviderConditionSnapshot` is
  identical.

(Mechanics land in the headless-migration PRs, not here. PR-1 is app-repo only
and touches no submodule.)

## PR roadmap

1. **PR-1 (this PR) — renderer framework.** Introduce `conditions-core` (the
   contract, view, generic outlet, dispatch) and route the EXISTING modals
   through it as drop-in view modules. Delete the per-provider hand-switch
   outlets. Behavior byte-identical. Codex is live-proven through the new path;
   Claude views are registered but DORMANT (no Claude emitter yet). The
   denormalization seam (applyConditionSnapshot, selectors, keybinds) is left
   untouched; the `attention` field is defined but not yet consumed.
2. **Codex headless onto the core**, with a byte-for-byte golden snapshot check
   proving the module-based emitter matches the current one exactly.
3. **Claude evaluator + slash-picker + shared toolkit** — builds the Claude
   headless emitter and the detection toolkit; this is what RESTORES Claude's
   currently-dead modals (PR-1's dormant Claude views light up here).
4. **AskUserQuestion module (hybrid)** — semantic liveness + screen-driven
   answering for the native question picker.
5. **Answering driver** — `sendThenReparse` and friends.
6. **Migrate remaining conditions + delete dead paths** — retire selectors.ts,
   the legacy per-event channels, and the denormalization seam left alone in
   PR-1; consume `attention` off the registered views.
```
